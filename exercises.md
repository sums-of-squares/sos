## Exercise 1

Consider the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 2 a x^2 + b$. For what
values of $(a,b)$ is this polynomial nonnegative? Draw the region of
nonnegativity in the $(a,b)$ plane. Where does the discriminant of $p$
vanish? How do you explain this?


## Exercise 2


Let $M(x,y,z) = x^4 y^ 2+ x^2 y^4 + z^6 - 3 x^2 y^2 z^2$ be the
  Motzkin polynomial. Show that $M(x,y,z)$ is not SOS, but
  $(x^2+y^2+z^2) \cdot M(x,y,z)$ is.


## Exercise 3

Give a rational certificate of the nonnegativity of the
trigonometric polynomial $p(\theta) = 5 - \sin \theta + \sin 2\theta - 3 \cos 3\theta$.


## Exercise 4

Consider a univariate polynomial of degree $d$, that is bounded by one
in absolute value on the interval $[-1,1]$. How large can its leading
coefficient be? Give an SOS formulation for this problem, solve it
numerically for $d=2,3,4,5$, and plot the found solutions. Can you
guess what the general solution is as a function of $d$? Can you
characterize the optimal polynomial?


## Exercise 5

Consider a given univariate rational function $r(x)$,
for which we want to find a good polynomial approximation $p(x)$ of
fixed degree $d$ on the interval $[-2,2]$.

1. Write an SOS formulation to compute the best polynomial approximation of $r(x)$ in the supremum norm.
2. Same as before, but now $p(x)$ is also required to be convex.
3. Same as before, but $p(x)$ is required to be a convex lower bound of $r(x)$ (i.e., $p(x) \leq r(x)$ for all $x \in [-2,2]$).
4. Let $r(x) = \frac{1-2 x+x^2}{1+x+x^2}$. Find the solution of the previous subproblems (for $d=4$), and plot them.

## Exercise 6

Consider the polynomial system $\{ x+y^3 =2, x^2+y^2=1\}$. 

1. Is it feasible over $\mathbb{C}$? How many solutions are there?
2. Is it feasible over $\mathbb{R}$? If not, give a Positivstellensatz-based infeasibility certificate of this fact.



## Exercise 7

Consider the butterfly curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the equation

$$
x^6 + y^6 = x^2.
$$

Give an sos certificate that the real locus of this curve is contained
in a disk of radius $5/4$. Is this the best possible constant?


## Exercise 8

Consider the quartic form in four variables 

$$
p(w,x,y,z) := w^4 + x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2 - 4wxyz.
$$

1. Show that $p(w, x, y, z)$ is not a sum of squares.
2. Find a multiplier $q(w,x,y,z)$ such that $q(w,x,y,z) p(w,x,y,z)$ is a sum of squares.

# Exercise 9

Consider a random variable $X$, with an unknown probability
distribution supported on the set $\Omega$, and for which we know its
first $d+1$ moments $(\mu_0,\ldots,\mu_d)$. We want to find bounds on
the probability of an event $S \subseteq \Omega$, i.e., want to bound
$P(X \in S)$. We assume $S$ and $\Omega$ are given intervals.
Consider the following optimization problem in the decision variables
$c_k$:

$$
\text{minimize} \sum_{k=0}^d c_k \mu_k \qquad
\mbox{s.t.} \quad 
\begin{cases}
\sum_{k=0}^d c_k x^k \geq 1 & \forall x \in S \\
\sum_{k=0}^d c_k x^k \geq 0 & \forall x \in \Omega.
\end{cases}
$$

1. Show that any feasible solution of this problem gives a valid upper
bound on $P(X \in S)$. How would you solve this problem?

2. Assume that $\Omega = [0,5]$, $S = [4,5]$, and we know that the
mean and variance of $X$ are equal to $1$ and $1/2$,
respectively. Give upper and lower bounds on $P(X \in S)$. Are these
bounds tight? Can you find the worst-case distributions?




# Exercise 10

The _stability number_ $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the
  cardinality of its largest stable set.  Define the ideal $I =
  \langle x_i (1-x_i) \quad i \in V, \quad x_i x_j \quad (i,j) \in E
  \rangle$.


1. Show that $\alpha(G)$ is _exactly_ given by 

$$
\min \gamma \qquad  \gamma - \sum_{i \in V} x_i  \quad \text{is SOS mod $I$}. 
$$

[**Hint:** recall (or prove!) that if $I$ is
  zero-dimensional and radical, then $p(x) \geq 0$ on $V(I)$ if and
  only if $p(x)$ is SOS mod $I$.]

2. Recall that a polynomial is 1-SOS if it can be written as a sum
  of squares of affine (degree 1) polynomials. Show that an upper
  bound on $\alpha(G)$ can be obtained by solving

$$
\min \gamma \qquad  \gamma - \sum_{i \in V} x_i  \quad \text{is 1-SOS mod $I$}. 
$$

3. Show that the given generators of the ideal $I$ are already a
  Gr√∂bner basis. Show that there is a natural bijection between
  standard monomials and stable sets of $G$.

4. As a consequence of the previous fact, show that $\alpha(G)$ is
  equal to the degree of the Hilbert function of $\mathbb{R}[x]/I$. 


Now let $G =(V,E)$ be the Petersen graph, shown below.

</p>

1. Find a stable set in the Petersen graph of maximum cardinality.

2. Solve this optimization problem for the Petersen graph. What is the
  corresponding upper bound?

3. Compute the Hilbert function of $I$ using Macaulay2, and verify
  that this answer is consistent with your previous results.





# Exercise 11

Consider linear maps between symmetric matrices, i.e., of the
form $\Lambda:\mathcal{S}^n \rightarrow \mathcal{S}^m$. A map is said
to be a _positive map_ if it maps the PSD cone $S^n_+$ into the
PSD cone $S^m_+$ (i.e., it preserves positive semidefinite matrices).


1. Show that any linear map of the form $A \mapsto \sum_i
P_i^T A P_i$, where $P_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, is positive. These maps
are known as _decomposable_ maps.

2. Show that the linear map $C:\mathcal{S}^3 \rightarrow
\mathcal{S}^3$ (due to M.-D. Choi) given by:

$$
C:A \mapsto 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 a_{11} + a_{22} &          0       &     0       \\
         0       & 2 a_{22} + a_{33} &    0  \\
        0        &           0      & 2 a_{33} + a_{11} 
\end{bmatrix} - A.
$$

is a positive map, but is not decomposable.




**Hint:** Consider the polynomial defined by $p(x,y) := y^T
\Lambda(x x^T) y$. How can you express positivity and decomposability
of the linear map $\Lambda$ in terms of the polynomial $p$?
